Ecosystem Simulation: Grass, Deer, adn Wolves

Organisms:

Grass:

Growth rate: +20 points per time step
Reproduction threshold: 250 points
Cannot die or be eaten by anything except deer

Deer:

Metabolism cost: -30 points per time step
Reproduction threshold: 900 points
Death threshold: -400 points
Can eat Grass to gain energy (200 points)

Wolf:

Metabolism cost: -15 points per time step
Reproduction threshold: 1000 points
Death threshold: -9000 points
Can eat deer to gain energy (700 points)

Interaction

Predation interactions where deer organisms eat the grass, and wolves eat the deer in return.
