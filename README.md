Ecosystem Simulation: Grass and Deer

Organisms

Grass

Reproduction threshold: 250 points
Cannot die or be eaten by anything except deer

Deer

Metabolism cost: -15 points per time step
Reproduction threshold: 1200 points
Death threshold: -400 points
Can eat Grass to gain energy

Interaction

Predation interaction where the deer organisms are eating the grass. Current issue where deer overgraze and eat all the grass.
